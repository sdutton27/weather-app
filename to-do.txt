- We want each of the items we are creating for the list container to
be able to be clickable and take you to that page (index, with recreating the data for that container?)

INDEX: needs to print the proper div instead of the card 
        - also appends the new div to the list... let's make a list to give it a class maybe?
        - need to give each div an ID through that so that the clear button works and deletes the item with that ID
            - woof that'll be hard
        - let's focus on the list.html first then!

- also get the proper timestamp


// we could make an extra outer div in the list.html so that every item may be appended to both .containers
BUT anything appended to the divs in those classes inside the .single-post might disappear
- maybe we format the grids / format the sizes of all the other divs so they are not included?
This could work


=============================================
THIS SHOULD WORK BELOW:

MAYBE!!!! we have an onclick method in the little menu button that uses the session storage and updates the HTML 

- in the earlier method, we save all the stuff to the sessionStorage()

- in this method we have a variable we name "open"
- if open, then we make all the list objects
- if close, then we just make the 1
-> I believe that the last key we add will be the latest addition, so that's how we can get the current one (when we close)
- each little card will have its own ID
- we assign an onclick to the cards too, so that when we click on a card,
    we call the method but set open to FALSE. it should give us the last object we saw.
- if open is FALSE and the button that made the call to the method was the menu button, then let's not print anything (set container.innerHTML to '')

this way we just have a single dynamic webpage all in index.HTML ^

==========================
To-Do List:
- format the loading and error messages (in middle)
- handle nighttime for the backgrounds
- sand background 
- handle zipcodes
- color for the fonts  - DONE
- figure out what data we want to put for the single-view 
- get a nicely formatted single view 
- work on the backend of connecting it all with the two viewpages

${new Date(new Date(data.dt).getTime() + (data.timezone * 1000))}
${new Date(data.dt * 1000 - (data.timezone * 1000)).getHours()}:${new Date(data.dt + (data.timezone * 1000)).getMinutes()}

can make a new Date that is .now(), get the UTC, and then add the offset to that?
